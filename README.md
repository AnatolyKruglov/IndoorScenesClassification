# Image Classification - Classification of Indoor Scenes

In this notebook, I train a neural network capable of recognising the type of a place shown in the picture. 

More formally, the problem is to accurately classify 15k images from the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/torralba/www/indoor.html">Interior Scene Recognition dataset</a> into 67 classes, each corresponding to a different space (bedroom, airport inside, bar etc.)

As a result, the network attained 85-86% accuracy on the test dataset
